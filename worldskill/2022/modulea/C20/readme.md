# Word Rank

## Create a function that takes a string of words and returns the highest scoring word. Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, etc.
## If two words score the same, return the word that appears first in the original string.
## The returned string should only contain alphabetic characters (a-z).
## Preserve case in the returned string.
## No media are provided.
